# GANs
Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)

This repository contains a foundational implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), designed to help users understand how GANs work in practice. It also includes prerequisite notebooks covering key concepts in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, providing the background necessary to follow and experiment with the implementation. Together, these resources offer a complete learning pathâ€”from understanding neural network fundamentals to building and training a basic GAN model.
